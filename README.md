# Lab 01 – Products, Architecture & Roles

To kickstart the course, you will explore two things:
>
> 1) How real software products are structured;
> 2) What kind of engineers build and operate them.
>

## Quick Start

1. **Setup**: Fork repo → Clone locally → Open in VS Code
2. **For each task**: Issue → Branch → Commits → PR → Review → Merge
3. **Start with**: [Task 1: Pick a product](./lab/tasks/required/task-1.md)

### Time estimates

| Section | Time |
|---------|------|
| [Setup](./lab/setup.md) | ~30 min |
| [Task 1](./lab/tasks/required/task-1.md) | ~30–40 min |
| [Task 2](./lab/tasks/required/task-2.md) | ~20–30 min |
| [Task 3](./lab/tasks/required/task-3.md) | ~30–40 min |
| **Total** | **~2–2.5 hours** |

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this lab you should be able to:

- Use GitHub to structure your work and collaborate with peers (issues, branches, pull requests, and reviews).
- Explain the basic architecture of a real-world digital product in terms of components, data flow, deployment, and tech roles.
- Reflect on your career in tech, examine your current skillset, and plan for the future.

## Tasks overview

To complete this lab, you will need to:

- Set up your `GitHub` account and this lab's repo.
- Pick an existing digital product.
- Sketch its architecture: components, data flow, deployment.
- Map components to tech roles and skills using real job postings and `roadmap.sh`.
- Practice using GitHub issues, branches and pull requests (PRs) to organize your work in a repository (repo) and get feedback from peers.

This and all other lab assignments will simulate real-life engineering practices:

- Follow processes;
- Communicate via issues/PRs;
- Keep the work reviewable;
- Write acceptance criteria;
- Write clear commit messages.

## Repo structure

- [`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/01-task.yml`](./.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/01-task.yml) - an issue form for a task.
- [`.github/pull_request_template.md`](./.github/pull_request_template.md) - a template for PRs.
- [`./docs/diagrams`](./docs/diagrams) - diagrams of the product's architecture.
- [`./.vscode/settings.json`](./.vscode/settings.json) - `VS Code` settings.
- [`./.vscode/extensions.json`](./.vscode/extensions.json) - recommended `VS Code` extensions.
- [`./lab/appendix.md`](./lab/appendix.md) - Additional info.

## Submission checklist

By the end of the lab:

- Make sure that each task that you have completed has a corresponding issue linked to a PR.
- Close the issues for which all related activities are done.
- Show your progress to the TA as your proceed with the lab. TA will share a link to the table to mark the status of your tasks.

## Required tasks

> [!TIP]
> **Start here** after completing the [lab setup](./lab/setup.md).

You work **independently** on the tasks below in your forked repo.

Follow the [procedure for each task](./lab/tasks/required/procedure.md).

Tasks:

1. [Pick a product and study its architecture](./lab/tasks/required/task-1.md)
2. [Tech roles involved in the selected product](./lab/tasks/required/task-2.md)
3. [My tech skills and the market: `roadmap.sh` and job postings](./lab/tasks/required/task-3.md)

---

## Optional tasks

> [!NOTE]
> Pick **one** optional task below. Still follow the [procedure for each task](./lab/tasks/required/procedure.md).

Tasks:

1. [Merge conflicts & resolution](./lab/tasks/optional/task-1.md).
2. [Add a CI check (`GitHub Actions`)](./lab/tasks/optional/task-2.md)
3. [Tag and release notes](./lab/tasks/optional/task-3.md)
4. [Skill development strategy (job market → deep learning → planning)](./lab/tasks/optional/task-4.md)

## Homework

- [ ] Read this [tutorial](https://hackmd.io/@aabounegm/SWP-git) to learn about `Git`, `Github`, and `Git` workflows.
- [ ] Practice on [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) (focus on merge/rebase and conflicts).
- [ ] Read about [`GitHub flow`](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow).
