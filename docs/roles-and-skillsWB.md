## Personal reflection

I chose the Junior Go Backend Developer role because I am interested in backend development and I like Go for its simplicity and performance.
As a first-year student, I already have basic Go knowledge, understand how backend services work.
However, compared to job requirements, I clearly lack experience with databases, testing, and production tools like Docker.
This semester I want to focus on learning SQL and PostgreSQL, because almost every backend job requires working with databases.
I also want to improve my understanding of Go testing, since writing reliable and maintainable code is important for real projects.
